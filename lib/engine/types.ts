/**
 * Canonical data model for the attribution core.
 *
 * The data contract floor (CAUSA.md §6.5): per workflow, verification needs
 * exactly three things — activity records (who/what ran, when), outcome
 * records (what happened to which entity, per the quality bar), and the join
 * key linking them. Join keys are deliberately NOT first-class on activity
 * records: they hide in semi-structured payloads and are mined by extraction
 * rules. Outcome events natively know their entity.
 *
 * Contracts, experiment designs, extraction rules, and verdict rules are all
 * serializable data; only their small interpreters are code. Replay =
 * (records hash, config hash, engine version).
